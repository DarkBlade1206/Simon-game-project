# Simon-game-project
A basic Simon's game project built with html, css and javascript.
You just have to press a key on the keyboard and the game starts with a blinking button and sound.
Now you have to remember the pattern in which the buttons blinked and repeat the pattern if you get it wrong then its game over.
Press any key to restart the game.
